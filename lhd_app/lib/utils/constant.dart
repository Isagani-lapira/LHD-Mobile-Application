        'German designers are working on what is a total passive solar design. In their quest for better energy efficient house plans they are hoping to build homes that rely solely on solar power. This means achieving the absolute best in insulation, solar gain, lot positioning of the home, etc., all while maintaining a workable plan that it is usable for each individual client. Their designs really impressed me. They are very close to achieving energy efficient home designs that rely on zero external power to maintain a comfortable living space.'

If the front of your house faces south, it should be designed in such a way that it looks good but also maximizes the amount of windows on that side. The same is true for the opposite: if the front of your house faces north it should have minimal windows but still have a great design to be attractive. \nBuilding a new home with an efficient heating system and inefficient insulation system is akin to driving a car in the winter time with the heater on high and the windows rolled down. Do not go there!',

These are custom-built to your energy efficient floor plans with the window and door openings precut when they arrive on the job site. The roof panels are also pre-cut to your specific roof design. \nThese panels add a much higher insulation value than a typical frame wall and roof. They can speed up construction, save energy for years and years to come, and make you a much happier home owner.'

So, unless the design incorporates a huge battery back-up system, at some point external power will be needed.\nThe unfortunate thing about these energy efficient house plans is that they can still be a little bit out of the reach of the ordinary working man. The good news is every year “green products” are becoming more affordable. There are various products on the market that will help you achieve an energy efficient home design without breaking the bank, but you will still need some external power source other than the sun.'

No matter what steps you take in designing your energy efficient house plans, if the insulation in the walls and roof is not adequate you are throwing money out the window. Not to mention a whole lot of heat!\nThe easiest solution to becoming energy efficient is to use structural insulated panels. These are available in many different forms, but the most effective form that I have found are the ones that are made in the factory and customized to your home.'
